# Maching Learning Project

This is the final project for the course CS-C3240 Machine Learning D 2022 at Aalto University.

## Aim
The project aims to develop a regression model to predict the cost of living indicator of the city based on population and country cost of living. The data sets used are from Numbeo (available on "https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/"), and Simplemaps (available on "https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities").

The project compares a linear regression model with a decision tree regressor for this machine learning problem.

## Result
The final model is chosen via K-Fold cross validation, and its performance on unseen data (test set) is recorded in the report. The relatively low mean squared errors indicate that further research into this matter can yield promising results.

## Details
Further details about the models and results can be found in project document (Report.pdf). This project uses Python, and the code can be run on Jupyter Notebook.
